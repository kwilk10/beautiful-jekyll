Hello! My name is Katherine and I am a biostatistician at the University of Vermont's Laboratory for Clinical Biochemistry Research and Department of Pathology. I obtained my masters degree in statistics from the University of Michigan where I also did analysis in health policy research using medical claims data. I work primarily in R, dabble occasionally in SAS and am actively learning Python. I am interested in all aspects of Applies Statistics, with my primary interests laying in consulting, health, and medicine. I like to consider myself a puzzle solver, I enjoy using data to answer problems and make people's lives easier.

Here you will find a small sample of work that I have done, primarily from courses taken during my masters degree. Keep an eye out for future projects as well though!
